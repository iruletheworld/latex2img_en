This project is a tutorial about how to convert Latex files directly to
images (generate image files while compiling Latex files). This tutorial
mainly focuses on how to convert pictures that are generated by tikz and
are embedded in the PDF into images of different formats.

This project would discuss the following image foramts.

* SVG (vector file)
* PNG (bitmap)
* EMF (vector file on Windows)
* EPS (commonly used for print)

This project aims to provide tutorials and examples based on Windows.
The author believes that Linux users are capable of doing this on their own.

This tutorial would provide guides for software installations and
configurations. This tutorial would also explain the processes with examples.

This tutorial assumes the user is already familiar with Latex to some
extend and thus would not explain Latex related configs in detail.

This tutorial would explain the processes in minute details. If you only
concern about the sole usage, you can firstly read
:doc:`/installation_and_configuration`, and then follow the instructions
in :doc:`/accelerated_guide`.
